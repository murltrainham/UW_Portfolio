# UW_Portfolio
Professional-Portfolio

Using HTML & CSS this is a portfolio for UW coding boot camp project 2. 

Lessons learned :

(a) Submit sub-par assignments and refine at a later date in neccissary (assignments can be submitted a total of 4 times).
(b) I still have unresolved issues with VSC/live server showing different formatting than the native resolutions of my screen. This is causing me to refomat issues that are non existant.
(c) Get better at nesting
(d) My intial layout was not well defined. Layout early and stick to the plan.
